  description: >
    We model distributed decision making in the transition to net-zero energy systems via bilevel optimization. By comparing the results of the transition to a model following the central planner approach, we find that neglecting stakeholder representation in energy system models can result in miscalculations of the need for capacity expansion.

  description: >
    Using a generic, process-agnostic model, we determine the value of industrial demand-side management within larger energy systems. We show that demand-side management can reduce total energy system costs by up to 4.4% or 20% of industry-related energy costs. However, the value of demand-side management  depends on the system‚Äôs flexibility alternatives.
