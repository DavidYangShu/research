    "text": "Postdoctoral Associate\n\nMIT Energy Initiative & Shin Group | ChemE | MIT \n\n\n Hey there!\nI am a postdoctoral associate at MIT working on the nonlinear optimal design of carbon capture units under uncertainty and reducing emissions from hard-to-abate industries. My research spans environmental life-cycle assessment, process optimization, and sustainable system design, with applications in carbon capture and storage technologies and the broader energy transition.\nIn my doctoral studies at ETH Zurich (Switzerland), I investigated the design and operation of net-zero energy systems employing multi-criterial optimization to evaluate trade-offs between economic and environmental objectives. I further applied bilevel optimization to model market interactions in the energy transition.\nIn my research, I have contributed to the Horizon 2020 project  DMX™ Demonstration in Dunkirk (3D) by performing life-cycle assessments for full-scale CCUS supply chains. I also evaluated the sustainability of carbon dioxide transport in the Swiss demonstration project  DemoUpCARMA, in which we captured and transported CO2 all the way fom Switzerland to Iceland for geological storage in basaltic rock.\nInterested in my research?

We show that demand-side management can reduce total energy system costs by up to 4.4% or 20% of industry-related energy costs. However, the value of demand-side management depends on the system’s flexibility alternatives.\n\n\n\nPatricia Mayer, Mario Heer, David Yang Shu, Nik Zielonka, Ludger Leenders, Florian Joseph Baader, André Bardow\n\n\n2024-07-18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOvercoming the central planner approach – Bilevel optimization of the European energy transition\n\n\nenergy systems\nLCA\noptimization\n\n\nWe model distributed decision making in the transition to net-zero energy systems via bilevel optimization.
