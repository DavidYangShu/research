My research spans environmental life-cycle assessment, process optimization, and sustainable system design, with applications in carbon capture and storage technologies and the broader energy transition.\nIn my doctoral studies at ETH Zurich (Switzerland), I investigated the design and operation of net-zero energy systems employing multi-criterial optimization to evaluate trade-offs between economic and environmental objectives. I further applied bilevel optimization to model market interactions in the energy transition.\nIn my research, I have contributed to the Horizon 2020 project  DMX‚Ñ¢ Demonstration in Dunkirk (3D) by performing life-cycle assessments for full-scale CCUS supply chains. I also evaluated the sustainability of carbon dioxide transport in the Swiss demonstration project  DemoUpCARMA , in which we captured and transported CO2 all the way fom Switzerland to Iceland for geological storage in basaltic rock.\nInterested in my research?
